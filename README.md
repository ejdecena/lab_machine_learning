# Machine Learning Lab.

This repository aims to establish a laboratory for the development of Machine Learning models based on docker.

## To install docker:
```bash
$ make install
```

## To run the laboratory:
```bash
$ make run
```
After running the lab with the above command, you can view the logs with the `make logs` command and then you can bring up the **Jupyter Notebook** interface, if you wish, with the instructions shown in the terminal.

## To view lab logs:
```bash
$ make logs
```

## To enter the laboratory environment:
```bash
$ make enter
```
Once inside the environment, you can run the different Machine Learning programs that are in the directory.

## To stop the laboratory environment:
```bash
$ make stop
```

## To restart the laboratory:
```bash
$ make restart
```
